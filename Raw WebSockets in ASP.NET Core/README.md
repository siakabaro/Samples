# Raw WebSockets in ASP.NET Core

This code sample is a demo web app that uses raw WebSockets in ASP.NET Core. Itâ€™s a Visual Studio Solution with an ASP.NET Core Web API project targeting .NET 9.0.

The solution is a basic web application that handles incoming web sockets connections and periodically pushes the server resources information (e.g. CPU, Memory used) to the connected clients. This example also includes a simple Echo request/response message handler that will just send back the message received from the client.
